-  StarAlt with transit times predictions, SIMBAD for ref info

-  Master Dark distribution to explain why median combine is better

-  Flats, no need to include distribution but do include calibration eqn

-  Report one bad pixel

-  Cite Astrometry.net, align images with WCS

-  Image of target with aperture

-  Image of circled source stars, red is target, green is reference

-  Light curve of one ref star

-  Light curve of ref star 9, removed from analysis

-  Baseline flux (see lab man for equations)
      After transit not good data, use pre-transit to calculate
      Pre transit, flux= 1.01010 +/- 0.00007
      During transit, flux= 0.97236 +/- 0.00008
    
      Error: individual ratios, sum of squares: 
              sig_ri = sqrt[ (sig_f/f)^2 + (sig_mu/mu)^2 ]

             Uncertainty on the average (cited above):
               sig_ravg = sqrt[ sum_N( sig_ri^2 ) ] / N

-   Image of normalized transit depth (see calculation steps in 4.5)
    Bin at 5 minute intervals
    Errorbars = uncertainty on the mean = stdev/sqrt(N)

-   Transit Depth = 0.0378 p/m 0.0001
      depth = f_before - f_transit
      sig_d = sqrt[ (sig_fb)^2 + (sig_ft)^2 ]

-   Planet-to-Star Radius Ratio = 0.1943 p/m 0.0003
      R = sqrt[depth]
      sig_R = sig_d / (2sqrt[d])

-   Predicted Transit duration: 2h1m10.9s (or 2.01968h)

-   Predicted Ingress: 9:52:59.9226 (local)
    Measured Ingress from lightcurve: 10:27:59.892 (local)

-   Predicted Mid-Transit Time: 10:53:35.379 (local)
    Measured Mid-Transit Time: 11:25:59.892 (local)

-   Predicted Egress: 11:54:10.8444 (local)
    Measured Egress: 12:02:59.892 (local)
