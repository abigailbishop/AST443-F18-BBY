CHECK IN 1

- Compare sat (point source) and sun
- Cannot resolve sun with one dish

CHECK IN 2

- Plot current vs time
- Use slew rate (delta angle / time of obs) to convert to radians
- Find difference in max and second max peaks to find 1/B_lambda
    deltaTheta =  1/B_lambda = lambda / B
    => B = lambda / deltaTheta
    lambda = 2.7cm
