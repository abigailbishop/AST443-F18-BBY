This directory contains all of the scripts for Lab1 in order of use

The inputs.txt contains all constants (like path names) that you may need for data analysis.
This file is loaded in as a dictionary. 
The name comes before the comma, the object comes after.
Please use no spaces. 
For relative paths, please do not begin with a '/', but do end with a '/'
For absolute paths, please begin and end with a '/'
For files, only give the file name

An example of how to load (and how we load) inputs.txt information into a script is available in loadConstants.py

PLEASE NOTE: you have to run "ls * > names.txt" in each directory with flats 
  before running any scripts
